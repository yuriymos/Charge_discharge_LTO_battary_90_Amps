The name of the progect is Charge discharge LTO battary 90 Amps.

Autor: Moskalev Yuriy.
This program was written using C.

A microcontroller ATmega16A is used to control
Lithium titanate battery charging and discharging process.

Charging and discharging process could be realise
with different currents in range from 1 to 90 Amps.

The project includes some files:
1) Control scheme using ATmega16A.
2) Schematic diagram of the power part of the charge/discharge device.
3) Program for charging and discharging process control.
